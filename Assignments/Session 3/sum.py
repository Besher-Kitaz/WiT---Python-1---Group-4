    We would to create a code that calculates the sum, from 0 to 10.
    We can achieve this using the while loop. Complete the code below to achieve the task.
"""

# first, we need a counter for our loop (iteration variable)

i = 0

# Now we need a variable to store the sum inside it. We assin 0 to it, because at the beginning, we have nothing. 
# Then, as the while starts working, we add the value of i to it.

sum = 0

# Continue from here. Create the while loop and calculate the sum


print(f"sum = {sum}")
