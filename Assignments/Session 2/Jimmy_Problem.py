"""
Jimmy would like to build a calculator that takes two inputs and returns their division. 
He built the following code: 
"""

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(num1 // num2)

"""However, Jimmy faced a problem. Whenever he enters a decimal number, the program results in an error (Traceback).
For example, if he entered 2.5, the calculator will give an error."""

# Change the code that Jimmy wrote to fix the problem
