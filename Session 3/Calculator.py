"""We would like to build a calculator that does a mathematical operation based on user input"""

# First, we ask for the first number:
num1 = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))

# Now we need to ask for the operation
operation = input("Please enter the operation")

# Lastly, we ask for the second number:
num2 = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

#Now, we can use the if statement to determine the operation we want to perform

if operation == "+":
    #write code here
    
#Continue with subtraction, multiplication and division. Don't forget to handle the case where we divide by zero.
